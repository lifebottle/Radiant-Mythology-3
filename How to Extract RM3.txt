HOW TO EXTRACT SCR FILES TO XML

I created a working directory on the root of my C:\ drive amd named this folder RM3
Unpack the game iso into a new folder named GAME
	- You should have C:\RM3\GAME with the files from the iso.

Extract the namco.bdi file
1. Build Namco File Project.exe
	a. Open Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022
	b. Input CD GitHub\Radiant-Mythology-3\Namco file project\Namco file project and hit enter
	c. Now run the command to build the EXE -- msbuild "Namco file project.csproj"
		- This will create a bin folder with the EXE ready to run.
2. Run the Namco File Project.exe
3. Click the Unpack button
	- Browse to C:\RM3\Game\PSP_GAME\USRDIR and select the namco.bdi file
	- The app will take a moment to process and then ask you where to save the extracted files
	- Create a new folder named namco_bdi and click ok
When asked if you would like it to try and assign extensions say no.
The namco.bdi file should now be extracted to C:\RM3\namco_bdi

Extract the .arc files from namco_bdi files
1. Copy the arc_extractor.bat and arc_extractor.py from the repo to the namco_bdi folder
	- May need to edit the bat and change the directory to ("C:\RM3\namco_bdi\*")
2. Run the arc_extractor.bat

Copy the .scr files into the same directory
1. Copy the scrcollector.py script into C:\RM3\namco_bdi
2. Run the scrcollector.py script
	- This will copy all the .scr files into C:\RM3\SCR_Files

Extract Japanese dialogue into XML format
1. Copy the SCR_Extract_CD.py to the C:\RM3\SCR_Files directory
2. Run SCR_Extract_CD.py
	- This will extract the Japanese dialogue into XML format.
	- This XML can be used to translate the dialogue for future reinsertion.
